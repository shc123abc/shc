C++ applications can be found in `cpp_sample programs` amd Machine learning applications can be found in `ml_sample_programs`. To execute all the ML sample applications, run the `execute_all_prog.sh` script present in the `ml_sample_programs` folder. 
Sample applications contain a valid input.yaml file. (More details about the input.yaml file can be found in `/docs/input_masterlist.yaml`.)
