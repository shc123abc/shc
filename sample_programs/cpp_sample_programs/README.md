# Steps to execute an application: 
1. Add the following environment variable:
```
export LLFI_BUILD_ROOT=<path to where LLFI has been built>
```

2. Call the `./compileAndRun.sh` script with appropriate arguments.
 
Example: For the `factorial` sample application, the first argument is 'factorial', and the second argument as the number to compute the factorial of (e.g., 6).
